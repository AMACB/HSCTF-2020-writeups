Opening [HillREVISED.txt](HillREVISED.txt) shows us an encryption key and ciphertext:

```
Encryption Key:
Coqfvpbbvzohmogzjjquohnonabjqippelaxnorxrvaxdllwubieletjauvfuktrymtkkdyfdtoos...

Ciphertext:
ieyirlxxtfiyfpsyvxcjmcdlpeftagszjhqjblyohgknhszyshfvuopozqwivkzeatqihkhdozkkv...
```

Based on the [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/2247/), the problem statement, and the name of the file, we guess that this is probably a Hill Cipher (which involves a matrix for decryption). Checking the length of the encryption key gives `10000`, which suggests that the encryption matrix is `100 x 100`. Additionally, the encryption key and ciphertext consist of only lowercase letters (apart from the capital `C`), so we are probably working mod `26`.

Let's load up sage to calculate the decryption matrix:

```
sage: enc_str = "coqfvpbbvzohmogzjjquohnonabjqippelaxnorxrvaxdllwubieletjauv..."
sage: enc_arr = [ord(x) - ord('a') for x in enc_str]
sage: enc_mat = Matrix(enc_arr, ring=Integers(26), nrows=100)
sage: dec_mat = enc_mat.inverse()
```

Now we decrypt the ciphertext by left multiplying it by the decryption matrix:

```
sage: ciphertext_str = "ieyirlxxtfiyfpsyvxcjmcdlpeftagszjhqjblyohgknhszyshfv..."
sage: ciphertext_arr = [ord(x) - ord('a') for x in ciphertext_str]
sage: ciphertext_mat = Matrix(ciphertext_arr, ring=Integers(26), ncols=100).transpose()
sage: plaintext_mat = (dec_mat * ciphertext_mat).transpose()
sage: plaintext_arr = [int(x) for x in plaintext_mat.list()]
sage: plaintext_str = ''.join([chr(x + ord('a')) for x in plaintext_arr])
sage: plaintext_str
ryjpureelbzjxqrgzlntnyzzkzaukwqcriugpqefejxhiwrvqiwhjyqzdxxohpfwmmwyzdsggvmvs...
```

At this point we can just skim through the text or try searching for common english words. Then, we get the flag:

```
sage: plaintext_str[3937:3988]
imaginegivingtheplaintextandnottheciphertextriplmao
```
